# Project 1:

# [Creating machine learning model by using ML SVM and deep learning RNN-LSTM models in google colab environment with tensorflow 2.0 Predicting Turkish Lira/Gold Price more than one day in the future with help of ML SVM and Deep Learning model RNN-LSTM in Google Colab Tensorflow 2.0 Environment](https://gist.github.com/Muttalip7402/0f26a456e2753a427dc034fe9664514a)

- Historical Turkish Gold prices have been scraped on the web by using python and selenium. 
- A Row dataset has been obtained. All values are in the dataset were being converted to their suitable datatype by using python commands.
- Some feature engineering operations have been made. Some columns are eliminated and some new columns are created.
- Data visualization
- Machine learning SVM (Support Vector Machine) and deep learning RNN-LSTM models created. 
- Predictions about future prices of Turksih Gold have been made both by using two models.

# Project 2:
# [End to end machine learning project about car price prediction.](https://github.com/Muttalip7402/CarPricePrediction/blob/main/ArabaFiyatTahmini.ipynb)

- Data about used cars has scraped on the web by using python and selenium. 
- A Row dataset has been obtained. All values are in the dataset were being converted to their suitable datatype by using python commands.
- Some feature engineering operations have been made. 
- Data visualization has been made by using python.
- Machine learning model created by using pycaret.
- Car price predictions have been done according to the model.

# Project 3:
# [Exploring dataset with python.](https://gist.github.com/Muttalip7402/57eb94e54c97a787a32188ade5a76d82)

- BOXPLOT. 
- A Row dataset has been obtained. All values are in the dataset were being converted to their suitable datatype by using python commands.
- Distribution - VIOLÄ°N
- Correlation - Basic Scatterplot
