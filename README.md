- a Row dataset has been obtained. All values are in dataset was being converted to its suitable datatype by using python commands.
- Some feature egnineering operations have been made. Some columns are elimanted and some new columns are created.
- Data visulation 
- Creating machine learning model by using ML SVM and deep learning model by using RNN-LSTM in google colab environment with tensorflow 2.0
Predicting Turkish Lira/Gold Price more than one day in the future with help of ML SVM and Deep Learning model RNN-LSTM in Google Colab Tensorflow 2.0 Environment (https://gist.github.com/Muttalip7402/0f26a456e2753a427dc034fe9664514a)
