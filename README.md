# [Creating machine learning model by using ML SVM and deep learning RNN-LSTM models in google colab environment with tensorflow 2.0 Predicting Turkish Lira/Gold Price more than one day in the future with help of ML SVM and Deep Learning model RNN-LSTM in Google Colab Tensorflow 2.0 Environment](https://gist.github.com/Muttalip7402/0f26a456e2753a427dc034fe9664514a)

- Historical Turkish Gold prices have been scraped on the web by using python and selenium. 
- A Row dataset has been obtained. All values are in the dataset were being converted to their suitable datatype by using python commands.
- Some feature engineering operations have been made. Some columns are eliminated and some new columns are created.
- Data visualization
- Machine learning SVM (Support Vector Machine) and deep learning RNN-LSTM models created. 
- Predictions about future prices of Turksih Gold have been made both by using two models.

# Project 2:
# [End to end machine learning project about car price prediction.](https://github.com/Muttalip7402/CarPricePrediction/blob/main/ArabaFiyatTahmini.ipynb)

- Data about used cars have been scraped on the web by using python and selenium.
- A Row dataset has been obtained. All values in the dataset were converted to their suitable data type by using python commands.
- Some feature engineering operations have been made.
- Data visualization has been made by using python.
- Machine learning model created by using pycaret.
- Car price predictions have been done according to the model.
# Project 3:
# [Exploring dataset with python.](https://gist.github.com/Muttalip7402/57eb94e54c97a787a32188ade5a76d82)

- BOXPLOT. 
- A Row dataset has been obtained. All values are in the dataset were being converted to their suitable datatype by using python commands.
- Distribution - VIOLÄ°N
- Correlation - Basic Scatterplot

# Project 4:
# [Exploring dataset with PowerBi.](https://github.com/Muttalip7402/PowerBiStudentPerformanceProject/blob/main/StudentPerformance.pdf)

- Student Dataset has been analyzed. Their math, reading, and writing performance were analyzed based on gender, race, and parental educational level by using power bi visualization techniques, Relational effects have been clarified.
