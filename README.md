# [Creating machine learning model by using ML SVM and deep learning RNN-LSTM models in google colab environment with tensorflow 2.0 Predicting Turkish Lira/Gold Price more than one day in the future with help of ML SVM and Deep Learning model RNN-LSTM in Google Colab Tensorflow 2.0 Environment](https://gist.github.com/Muttalip7402/0f26a456e2753a427dc034fe9664514a)

- Historical Turkish Gold prices have been scraped on the web by using python and selenium. 
- A Row dataset has been obtained. All values are in the dataset were being converted to their suitable datatype by using python commands.
- Some feature engineering operations have been made. Some columns are eliminated and some new columns are created.
- Data visualization
